                            Hello! My name is Jeff, and I'm glad that you have found my portfolio page.
                            The purpose is to display my skill set as an aide to beneficial networking, and to showcase these
                            skills to potential employers.
                            Here you will find examples of projects that I have completed, including front-end, back-end, and
                            database manipulation, as well as an academic and personal background, and contact information.
                            <br><br>
                            I have a diverse work background, and have been able to exceed expectations in many of my roles.
                            I have worked in roles from data recording, to engineering. Feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WDIdbwT0QxWhvHmu-GQ82ObU2oevGLYs/view?usp=sharing">Resume</a>. I hope that you will take a moment to click the link and view my resume, it is also available for download.
